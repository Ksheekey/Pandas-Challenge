I DID THE HEROES OF PYMOLI

http://127.0.0.1:8888/notebooks/HeroesOfPymoli/HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb

3 observable trends based on data:

1.) Males play more than females and Non-Disclosed, even when those two are combined
2.) People in their 20's make up more than half of the people playing 
3.) The most profitable item in the game is Final Critic

General notes:

I collpased all code that wasn't the overall answer, so you can open those up and see what I did step by step. I also tagged where the answer was, example #ANSWER 1** tells you were the answer to the first set of instruction was. I tried to make commits as often as I could. This hw was challenging but fun, I really like how it was structured with getting more and more difficult as you went along, asking for more in general and more demanding codes and groups and all that good stuff. I placed the URL above as well as will give you link to the repo.

Thank you!
